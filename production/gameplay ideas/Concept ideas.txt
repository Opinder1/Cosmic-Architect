[Seeds]
A world map has a public and private seed.
The public seed is sent to clients and allows them to generate "fake" chunks to fill in space.
The private seed is only known by the server and is used to populate the chunks.

[Chunks]
Client chunks will have a "real" state which dictates whether the chunk was sent by the server or not. "fake" chunks were generated with only the public seed

Client chunks will have a "ghost" state which dictates whether the chunk is constantly updated by the server or not.
"ghost" chunks can be cached on the client meaning it wont ask the server for them again. There is an option to not cache "fake" chunks.

[View Distance]
The server view distance will usually be 8 and is constant between all players. It dictates the region around the player that chunks are loaded and constantly updated.
The server will always send the view distance of chunks to clients regardless of their view distance.

The client view distance dictates how far the client will render chunks. It will be minimised to the server distance if its too low.
If the clients distance is greater than the server it can ask for "one time" chunks to fill in the surrounding area. There is an option to allow re asking "ghost" chunks. There is an option to allow "fake" chunks to be overwritten.

The server will have a queue of all the recent "one time" chunks it sent to the client. There is an option to set its size.
Every X ticks the earliest "one time" chunks is removed from the list. If the client reaches the limit it will have to start generating "fake" chunks.

[Vertical slots]
Server chunks will have a "blocks" value that stores how many blocks they have. 0 will indicate it is empty.
Each vertical slot on a world map will have a "highest chunk". This is calculated by finding the first chunk down which is not empty. If a chunks "blocks" changes between 0 and 1 the "highest chunk" can be recalculated.

When a client reaches a certain vertical slot if their velocity is greater than X then only the "highest chunk" will be sent. Then a timer will be started and if the velocity is lower than X by Y seconds the slot is fully loaded.



<<< Galaxy >>>

[Server]
Each server area encompasses a single galaxy.

[Galaxy]
The galaxy contains many star systems that each are owned by different politicial groups.

[Star system]
A star system is star or a group of stars that orbit each other. This center group is the star system "nucleus".
Many objects orbit the "nucleus" which include planets and their moons, asteroid belts, space stations, starship fleets and other potential objects.

[Planets and moons]
A planet or moon has a single main voxel space that defines the landmass. This voxel space also a loops in the x and z axis.
They can have towns and cities which have citizens that live there.

[Space station]
A structure that is more or less a city in space.
Can do many functions like act as a starship port, house citizens and hold farms.

[Space ship]
A structure that can easily fly. It can land on a planet, space station or even another larger space ship

[Vehicle]
A non space ship that is effected by gravity. Can be on a planet, space station or large space ship
